TGM Updater
===========

It's time that the private and commercial plugin world inside of WordPress get serious about automatic plugin updates. With the newly minted TGM Updater class, you now have no excuse. :-)

The TGM Updater class is a modification of the automatic updater class used inside of Soliloquy, my own (and the best) responsive WordPress slider plugin. It has been tested, refined, used and abused on over 10,000 WordPress installs. To put it short - **this class simply works.** Just follow the instructions correctly and you will be up and running with your own automatic plugin updates in no time flat!
